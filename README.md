# arduino-motor-servo-timer-conflict-solver
An Arduino sketch for a 4WD Bluetooth-controlled car that solves the hardware timer conflict between the Adafruit Motor Shield (AFMotor.h) and the Servo.h library. Implements a mode-switching system to safely toggle between DC motor and servo control, preventing shield overheating and damage.
